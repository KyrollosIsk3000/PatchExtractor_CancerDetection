# PatchExtractor_CancerDetection

The patch extractor script file, KI_PatchExtractor.py, is the patch extractor script I, Kyrollos Iskandar, developed and used for my MC215 Master of Medical Physics research project in 2021. I am continuing to work on the research project as of 19 May 2022. Therefore, this patch extractor script file is a work in progress, as it is part of the project, and may be updated. I expect to publish appropriate documentation for the patch extractor script once the project is concluded.

Please check the RequiredCopyrightedScriptFiles.txt file for other parties' copyrighted script files that are needed for my patch extractor script to work.

Note that the patch extractor script will currently work only with the "A Large-Scale CT and PET/CT Dataset for Lung Cancer Diagnosis (Lung-PET-CT-Dx)" dataset, which is available at https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=70224216, due to hard-coded named references to the data directories.
