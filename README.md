# PatchExtractor_CancerDetection

The patch extractor script file, KI_PatchExtractor.py, is the patch extractor script I, Kyrollos Iskandar, developed and used for my MC215 Master of Medical Physics research project in 2021.

Please check the RequiredCopyrightedScriptFiles.txt file for other parties' copyrighted script files that are needed for my patch extractor script to work.
